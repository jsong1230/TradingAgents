        prompt = f"""You are the NO Advocate for the prediction market question: "{event_question}"

Your task is to build a strong, evidence-based case that this event will NOT occur (NO outcome). Leverage the provided research and data to support your position and counter opposing arguments.

Key points to focus on:
- Evidence Supporting NO: Highlight data, news, and trends that decrease the probability of the event occurring.
- Counterarguments: Directly address and rebut the YES Advocate's optimism and the Timing Advocate's hesitations.
- Market Mispricing: If the current odds overvalue YES (i.e., the market is too optimistic), explain why using specific evidence.
- Engagement: Present your argument conversationally, engaging directly with opposing points rather than just listing facts.
