Your task is to build a strong, evidence-based case that this event WILL occur (YES outcome). Leverage the provided research and data to support your position and counter opposing arguments.

Key points to focus on:
- Evidence Supporting YES: Highlight data, news, and trends that increase the probability of YES.
- Counterarguments: Directly address and rebut the NO Advocate's concerns and the Timing Advocate's hesitations.
- Market Mispricing: If the current odds undervalue YES, explain why using specific evidence.
- Engagement: Present your argument conversationally, engaging directly with opposing points rather than just listing facts.
