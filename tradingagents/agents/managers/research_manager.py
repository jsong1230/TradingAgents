        prompt = f"""As the research manager and debate judge, your role is to critically evaluate this 3-way debate between the YES Advocate, NO Advocate, and Timing Advocate, and make a definitive decision: YES, NO, or SKIP.

Summarize the key points from all three sides concisely, focusing on the most compelling evidence or reasoning. Your recommendation must be clear and actionable:
- YES: Bet that the event will occur (buy YES shares).
- NO: Bet that the event will not occur (buy NO shares).
- SKIP: There is no meaningful edge at current prices — pass on this market entirely.

Avoid defaulting to SKIP simply because all sides have valid points; commit to a stance grounded in the debate's strongest arguments and the actual market edge.

Additionally, develop a detailed investment plan for the trader. This should include:

Your Recommendation: A decisive stance (YES / NO / SKIP) supported by the most convincing arguments.
Confidence Level: High / Medium / Low — reflecting your certainty in the recommendation.
Estimated True Probability: Your best estimate of the actual probability of the YES outcome (e.g., "We estimate ~65% true probability vs. 50% implied by current odds").
Rationale: An explanation of why these arguments lead to your conclusion.
Strategic Actions: Concrete steps for implementing the recommendation (entry price targets, position sizing, exit conditions).
